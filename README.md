# django-Financas_Pessoais



### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Django] - Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code.
* [Python-Venv] - The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories
* [MySQL] - MySQL is an Oracle-backed open source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL).


### Installation

```sh
$ cd FinançasPessoais_Django_Jenkins_Docker
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
